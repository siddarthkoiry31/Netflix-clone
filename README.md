# Netflix Clone

Welcome to my Netflix Clone repository! This project is a frontend implementation aimed at replicating the core visual elements and user interface of the popular streaming platform Netflix, using only HTML and CSS. Through the power of these web technologies, I've recreated the familiar layout and design that users have come to love. From the sleek navigation bar to the immersive carousel of movie posters, every detail has been carefully crafted to provide an authentic Netflix-like experience. Whether I'm a developer seeking to understand frontend web development or a user eager to relive the Netflix interface, this clone is designed to meet my needs. Dive into the codebase, explore the structure, and enjoy the nostalgic journey of browsing through your favorite movies and TV shows!
